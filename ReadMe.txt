To run this game you must enter the code folder. Once in the code folder you need to run the command python main.py. To play the game you use WASD to move around. 
If you get an error about no module containg pytmx this is due to the fact that I am using a 3rd party module to get the data from a 3rd party map making software.
To install this please run this command "pip install pytmx"
